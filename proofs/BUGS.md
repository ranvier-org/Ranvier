# Defect ledger

Only Confirmed entries count as bugs. Where `src/Ranvier/Core.fs` documents a behaviour as
intended, the entry closes as "spec corrected".

## Suspected

## Modelled

## Confirmed

## Awaiting ruling

- `reference_run_redundant` (`theories/Reference/Properties.v`): the reference tier itself has a
  redundant run. A round's run set comes from its starting snapshot, and an earlier effect of the
  round can restore the value a later one read. Under `t_rev`, the `resetting` program re-runs effect
  8 on the value of its previous run. The definition follows the ruling for Task 3. The question for
  the owner: does a run set stay fixed at the round's start, or does a run re-compare when its turn
  comes? Not a Core.fs defect.

## Closed

## Definition changes

Changes to `redundant` from its first statement in the plan.

- `redundant : rprog -> list event -> nid -> nat -> Prop` became
  `redundant : rprog -> list run -> nid -> nat -> Prop`. A `list event` holds no read values, and
  neither does `rprog`, since the values depend on the history. The prose definition, "every value
  it read is equal to its previous run's", needs them. A `run` holds the reads and the events of one
  run, and `rtrace` is the concatenation of `run_events` over `rruns`.
- "Equal to its previous run's" reads as: each `(node, outcome)` the run read also occurs in the
  previous run's reads. A run with no tracked reads is redundant. The initial run has no previous run
  and is not redundant.
